Description: This package helps to deal with the geochemistry data processing
    of a typical routine after the analysis. It read a default flat file of the
    GEOSOL/SGS report, storing the metadata into an object, and skipping header and 
    footer lines. Also, it is able to filter the elements by the number of non-censured
    data, replaces the censured data to default values, transform the data into minmax
    or centered log-ratio distribution, and more. Written to be used by the Geochemistry
    Division Team of the Geological Survey of Brazil.
